# react-native-starter

This repo demonstrates utilizing [@lifeomic/react-native-sdk] for a branded app.

## Getting Started

- `yarn install`
- `cd ios && pod install && cd ../`
- `yarn start`
- type `i` or `a` to run on either platform

## Where to look

We generated this app by running `npx react-native init StarterApp`. There are a
lot of files and config here, but it's important to understand that 99% of that
is boilerplate react-native. You might want to focus in on the files in the
`src` directory - which should be minimal. With the shell of a react-native app
and `@lifeomic/react-native-sdk` (and its peer dependencies), you can have an
app running locally in minutes.
